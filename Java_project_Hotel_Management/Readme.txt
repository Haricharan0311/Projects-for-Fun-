						Hotel management system

Project summary:
To make a Hotel management system to handle tasks like booking a room, vacating a room, Listing the status 
of the rooms, Searching for a occupied room and Transferring the details into a offline cloud.

Objectives:
●	To make and manage details of Rooms
●	To manage Clients who occupy Rooms
●	To manage the offline Cloud 

Definition of the problem:

Managing a Hotel involves complex problems like having a back end system to keep track of all the 
Clients occupied, in addition to this we keep track of whether rooms are occupied and design a UI from 
which the user can easily go through these tasks and make the Hotel management a simple rather than a tedious task. All these challenges can be tackled using Object Oriented Programming concepts in Java. The goal is to create a suitable backend interface for optimal resource management and ease of customer.

OOPs concepts used:
1.	Packages
2.	Data abstraction
3.	Encapsulation
4.	Dynamic binding
5.	Delegation
6.	Collection Framework
7.	Error Handling System

Elaboration:
1.	Packages – Packages is a key notion in Object Oriented Programming used to 
	encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. They help in avoiding naming conflicts and also help in reusability of code. 

2.	Data abstraction - The act of portraying important qualities without incorporating background details 
	or explanations is known as abstraction. When data abstraction is employed, the user is not exposed to 
	the inner workings of the program.

3.	Encapsulation - The wrapping of data and functions into a single unit is known as Encapsulation.
	The data is not accessible to the outside world. This is performed using access specifiers like public, 
	private and protected. 

4.	Dynamic binding - Binding refers to the linking of a procedure call to the code to be executed 
	in response to the call. The code associated with a given procedure is not known until the time of 
	the call at run-time. 

5.	Delegation -  When you delegate, you utilise an object from another class as an instance 
	variable and send messages to it

6.	Collection Framework – A framework that provides architecture to store and manipulate data in a 
	group of objects. It helps by simplifying the way Data is stored and with the help of Generics, 
	greatly increases reusability of code.

7.	Error Handling System – A mechanism that helps in handling unexpected errors that would 
	usually cause the program to terminate abnormally. By handling these errors, 
	we can fix the mistakes caused by improper input from the user while allowing the program 
	to run as intended.

Project Details

The data from the program is stored in an Offline cloud system(data.txt), so that the program can be run over 
multiple iterations and the data stored is static and in the memory
The directory/Package HotelDetails contains the packages needed for executing the program the menu for the user 
and the room booking entity
These pavckages are invoked in the main program and hence used to implement a Hotel room reservation system
